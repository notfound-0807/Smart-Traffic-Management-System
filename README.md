# Smart City Adaptive Traffic Management System 🚦

## 📌 About
This project is a simulation-based Smart City Traffic Management System developed in C++.
It dynamically controls traffic signals based on traffic density, emergency vehicles, pedestrian requests, and waiting time.

This project is submitted as a **Minor Project** for B.Tech CSE.
